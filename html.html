/* 

Build a very basic web page. As you go, make commits at the following points:

- after you put in the basic HTML scaffolding ('<DOCTYPE html> i <html>)
- after you add some body content
- when you add a stylesheet with some styles
- after you add a navigation bar
- when your project is complete. 

Make sure to leave descriptive commit messages for each commit! */
